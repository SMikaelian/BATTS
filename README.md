# BATTS
Ballistic Acquisition Telemetry and Trajectory System using an Arduino to report telemetry from a self-contained device such as a drone to a fixed ground station.


#### Questions:
* What communication protocol should be used by each device?
* What is the range of the radios being used?
* What devices are being used?
 - Currently: Arduino Mega 2560, Teensy 3.2, 3R 915MHz radios, and the MPU-9250 board.
